summary: Big shifts away from social media and toward a more personal, independent web are underway. Does that mean a return to old tools or a need for something else?

Major upheavals in in the way we interact with the web have been in the wind for the past year or so, kicked off by Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter and the subsequent invasion of Nazis and generally reprehensible shitheads over there. Initially his takeover prompted a mass-migration of reasonable people away from that site to alternatives like Mastodon, and then Bluesky or Threads.

At first there was a sense that people were looking for a replacement for what Twitter provided. But as time went on a new theme started to become more prominent as people started posting about their nostalgia for the "old web." A resurgence of interest in old, established technologies like RSS began.
This all coincided with the final year of my bachelor computer science program. Over the last two years of that degree, I had attempted to create a web-based RSS reader. Inexperience and an almost total lack of free time (I worked full-time as a journalist while getting my degree) repeatedly undermined my ability to create a finished product. I started again as soon as the degree was finished at the end of 2023 and I'm pretty close to a solid MVP.

The project's called "Current," because I'm angling its functionality toward what a journalist might need. Right now it's limited to finding and subscribing to feeds, marking entries as "Read" or "Unread," and the beginnings of a custom "Collections" system that allows users to, you know, put posts and feeds in their own collections. Nothing groundbreaking.
Once I have all of the basic functionality nailed down, the plan is to add notes and annotations, because that feels like a useful addition to a feed reader for journalists. I toyed with the idea of creating a more fully-fledged editor or story composer with the ability to link sources, but that feels like a different app.

While working on Current, I've been following what people on Mastodon have been saying about RSS and the old web. I've been getting the sense that, while there's definitely been a resurgence of RSS, people still feel like something's missing. Amadeus Maximilian, who helpfully provided a link to his blog so I could test feed discovery on Current, wrote about his struggles with finding a solution in [Creating the Perfect Newsfeed](https://amxmln.com/blog/2024/creating-the-perfect-newsfeed/). Part of what he misses is an algorithm that surfaces interesting stuff he probably would have missed if his feed was just a list of "Unread" items. Chris McLeod wrote about wanting some alternative to feed readers in [Visiting Websites](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/visiting-websites/). In that post he talked about wanting to actually visit sites with new or interesting updates and links to several writers who are looking for something similar. It feels like people like RSS but need something more, something that connects them to other people's creative spaces rather than to their stripped-down content. I agree, which is awkward considering I'm getting close to the tail-end of developing regular RSS reader.

When Reddit was first getting off the ground, before subreddits existed and it was acquired by Conde Nast, the site was pitched as a thoughtful alternative to Digg. The whole thing was a list of links to websites with discussion and voting. That's pretty much it. Of course, there were also posts that didn't include external links. It was a fun community and a fantastic way to find interesting things. I'm not saying it needs to be recreated, but I do wonder what part user participation should play in this realm.

The experience of the past decade or so makes me distrust engagement as a good metric for surfacing interesting sites. Upvotes and downvotes are also not enough because of the potential for "hive-mind" abuse. Nobody wants to become a victim of thoughtless zeitgeist.

I'm going to continue working the base functionality of Current as an RSS reader, but while I'm doing so I'm going to be trying to figure out how it might fit in to this need for something more. It could be as simple as listing more popular posts before others, but I feel like that's just a recipe for ensuring new or struggling sites remain in obscurity.
