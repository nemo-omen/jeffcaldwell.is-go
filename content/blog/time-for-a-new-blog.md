So, I rewrote my site again. Last weekend, while I was working on an RSS reader I'm naming Current, I decided I needed to start writing about the process. So, I did the logical thing and proceeded to write my site from scratch.

At first, I reached for one of my favorite tools for making content sites, [Astro](https://astro.build). Things moved along really quickly, as they usually do when you're making an Astro site. Halfway through, I started feeling like I needed something more.

Now, as I said, I really like Astro. I like JavaScript. But, writing everything in the same language all the time starts to feel like a drag. I wanted to do something different.

I'd been messing around with writing some Go for a few weeks and had read about how well the language handles http servers and thought it would be good exercise to write a simple blog site with it. I'll save the walkthrough about how I built everything for another post. For now, I'm just glad to have the site up, even if it's not totally finished.

I'll be working on a real projects page over the next few days, along with some other fun experiments I'll write about soon. Feel free to <a href="/subscribe">subscribe</a> if you want to keep up with what I'm doing.

Welcome to my site! I'm glad you're here.
