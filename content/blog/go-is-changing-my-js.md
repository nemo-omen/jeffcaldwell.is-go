I've been learning Go for the last month or so, and most of the code I've encountered is similar to Croll's JavaScript code. It's almost always very easy to figure out what's happening in any given module. In fact, simplicity is one of the hallmarks of the language and that ethos of simplicity is reflected in the culture of people who write Go. Reading and writing in the language is starting to change my approach to JavaScript, and I think it's helping me to be a better coder.

I like JavaScript. It's the first language I learned to code with and I generally feel comfortable with all of its quirks. It's not the only language I'm familiar with. I just finished a CS degree where the primary language was C++ and one of my biggest projects was written in Python. I even spent a couple of semesters writing Java. All of those languages can be written with simplicity and clarity in mind, but 

One of my favorite libraries in Angus Croll's [just](https://anguscroll.com/just/). If you look at the source for pretty much any of the modules in that library, what you'll find is straightforward, easy to read, easy to reason about code. It's nothing fancy, and that's what makes it so good.

I'm not saying I'm a master of any of those languages, including JavaScript. But each time I've explored a language I've never used, my understanding of programming grows. I learn more about how to code and what makes a good program, no matter what language it's written in. Not only that â€” I learn more about the kind of code I like.
