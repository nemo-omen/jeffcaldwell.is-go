It's good to be familiar with more than one programming language.

I like JavaScript. It's the first language I learned to code with and I generally feel comfortable with all of its quirks. It's not the only language I'm familiar with, though. I just finished a CS degree where the primary language was C++ and one of my biggest projects was written in Python. I even spent a couple of semesters writing Java.

I'm not saying I'm a master of any of those languages, including JavaScript. But each time I've explored a language I've never used, my understanding of programming grows. I learn more about how to code and what makes a good program, no matter what language it's written in. Not only that â€” I learn more about the kind of code I like.

One of my favorite libraries in Angus Croll's [just](https://anguscroll.com/just/). If you look at the source for pretty much any of the modules in that library, what you'll find is straightforward, easy to read, easy to reason about code. It's nothing fancy, and that's what makes it so good.
