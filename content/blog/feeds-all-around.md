If you're into RSS and you're on Mastodon, you'll love [Feeds All Around](https://rss-is-dead.lol/), created by [Paul Cuth](https://mastodon.social/@paulcuth). It's a really great tool that allows you to input your Fediverse handle and find all of the feeds published by the accounts you follow.

His work comes at a perfect time for me. I'm working on a feed reader and I want as many different sites with feeds as I can find. The site also has a very nice design. I hope it stays around for a long time!
